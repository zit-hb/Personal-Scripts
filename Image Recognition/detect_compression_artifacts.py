# Script: detect_compression_artifacts.py
#
# Description:
# This script detects images that exhibit high compression artifacts, such as JPEG artifacts.
# It analyzes images using a blockiness-based metric to quantify the presence of compression artifacts.
# It supports batch processing and allows you to set a threshold for artifact detection.
#
# Usage:
# ./detect_compression_artifacts.py [image_file|image_directory] [options]
#
# Arguments:
#   - [image_file]: The path to the input image file.
#   - [image_directory]: The path to the input image directory (when using --batch/-B).
#
# Options:
#   -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD    Threshold for compression artifact detection (default: 1000.0).
#   -B, --batch                            Process a batch of images in a directory.
#   -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output OUTPUT_FILE   Output file to save the results.
#
# Returns: Exit code 0 if all images have low compression artifacts, 1 if any image has high artifacts.
#
# Template: ubuntu22.04
#
# Requirements:
#   - OpenCV (install via: apt-get install -y python3-opencv)

    """
    Calculates a compression artifact score based on blockiness detection.
    A common compression artifact in JPEG images is blockiness caused by the 8x8 DCT blocks.

    Approach:
    - Convert the image to grayscale.
    - JPEG compression typically operates on 8x8 pixel blocks. Compression artifacts often manifest
      as discontinuities along block boundaries.
    - We measure blockiness by summing the absolute differences in intensity across the vertical and horizontal
      boundaries that align with 8-pixel multiples.

    Steps:
    1. Convert the image to grayscale.
    2. For every vertical boundary at columns x = 8, 16, 24, ...:
       - Compute the absolute difference between pixels at column x-1 and x for all rows.
       - Sum these differences to get the vertical blockiness contribution.
    3. For every horizontal boundary at rows y = 8, 16, 24, ...:
       - Compute the absolute difference between pixels at row y-1 and y for all columns.
       - Sum these differences to get the horizontal blockiness contribution.
    4. The final artifact score is the sum of vertical and horizontal blockiness values.

    This metric will be higher for images with more pronounced block boundaries, which often correlate
    with high compression artifacts.

    Note:
    - This is a heuristic that focuses primarily on blockiness, a common JPEG artifact.
    - In practice, other factors may influence perceived compression quality, but this provides a
      logical, block-based approach for measuring common JPEG-like artifacts.
